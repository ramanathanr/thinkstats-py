__Do first babies arrive late?__
As the on-time pregnancy length is considered to be 38 to 40 weeks, lets consider babies born week 41 onwards to have arrived late.
Based on statistical analysis of the [National Survey of Family Growth][1] data, first babies are 66% more likely to be born late than other borns. However most number of babies were born on-time, in week 38.
So though most number of first borns are born on-time, there is a higher chance for the first child to be born late.
